# Wall-Following-Mobile-Robot
Python-based program used to control the Pioneer 3DX mobile robot in CoppeliaSim (V-REP).

We created a program that will allow the Pioneer 3DX mobile robot to wander randomly within a given environment until a wall is detected and follow it in a determined direction. This is achieved through Finite State Machine or Subsumption architecture and takes use of the robot's ultrasonic sensors.
